layout: default
title: Text input with supporting text
usage: A different style of text for the supporting text separates it from the element label.  The label should follow sentence case; that is Upper case first word, then lower case second word(s).  Support text should be used to give key information that is essentially to complete the form field. Examples include password format and explanations for data collection.
