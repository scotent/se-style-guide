layout: default
title: Text input
usage: Group form fields together into smaller chunks, this makes the form feel easier to complete and less intimidating. Labels should always be used as screen-readers will have problems if they are omitted. The wrapping label pattern is preferred over the use of the for attribute, as this requires a corresponding id on the target form input, which may change according to how it needs to be integrated with a backend system. All inputs have autocorrect="off" added for usability on mobiles and tablets.
