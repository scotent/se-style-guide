layout: code-examples
collection-name: Typography
title: Inline, split definition list
sub-title: Settings and tags for 'Descriptive Lists'
usage: Displays the definition title and the description(s) on the same line floated away from each other. Only use one 'dd' per 'dt'. It does work well with long 'dds' though

<dl class="list--definition--float">
  <dt>Category:</dt>
  <dd>Grants for companies. This is a very long description</dd>
</dl>
