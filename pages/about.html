<h1>A library of visual and interaction patterns for Scottish Enterprise digital interfaces</h1>
<p>These patterns and UI components were created during the UX design, graphic design and front-end development work for the Scottish Enterprise.</p>
<p>They have been developed with scalability and reuse in mind. </p>
<p>This site is designed to be both a front-end framework and a toolkit that can be used to develop responsive, mobile-first web interfaces for Scottish Enterprise. It contains supporting notes for designers and front-end developers.</p>
<p>It can be considered a <strong>living style guide</strong> â€“ the code, demos and supporting documentation are generated from the same source files as the front-end production code. It should naturally evolve and provide long term value.</p>
<p>The approach taken to design and development on this project has followed the UK Government Digital Services (GDS) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">service manual</a>. The patterns, components and pages have been tested with target users, to evaluate their validity as interface components.</p>
